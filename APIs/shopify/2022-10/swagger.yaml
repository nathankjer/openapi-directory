      description: Generate an account activation URL for a customer whose account
        is not yet enabled. This is useful when you've imported a large number of
        customers and want to send them activation emails all at once. Using this
        approach, you'll need to generate and send the activation emails yourself.
        The account activation URL generated by this endpoint is for one-time use
        and will expire after 30 days. If you make a new POST request to this endpoint,
        then a new URL will be generated. The new URL will be again valid for 30 days,
        but the previous URL will no longer be valid.

    post:
      description: 'Creates a draft order. Using the DraftOrder resource you can create
        orders in draft state using product variant line items, or custom line items.
        To create a product variant draft order, provide the variant_id, quantity
        and discount properties. To create a custom line item, provide the title,
        price, taxable, and quantity properties. Note If you are using this endpoint
        with a Partner development store or a trial store, then you can only create
        five draft orders per minute. Polling When you create and update draft orders
        some calculations are done asynchronously, such as calculating shipping and
        taxes. There might be times when a draft order is created but these calculations
        haven''t completed. In these cases, you need to poll the draft order until
        the calculations are finished. When a draft order requires polling, a 202
        accepted response code is returned along with location and retry-after response
        headers. The location header refers to the URL to be polled, and retry-after
        denotes the interval (in seconds) at which polling requests should be sent.
        When the draft order is ready, a 200 OK response code will be returned. About
        custom shipping lines You can use the DraftOrder resource to send orders with
        custom shipping lines. A custom shipping line includes a title and price with
        handle set to Nil. A shipping line with a carrier provided shipping rate (currently
        set via the Shopify admin) includes the shipping rate handle. Applying discounts
        A draft order and its line items can have one discount each. Calculations
        for discounts are based on the setting of the value_type property, which can
        be set to either fixed_amount or percentage. For example, you can apply a
        fixed amount discount to a draft order to reduce the price by the specified
        value property. When you use a percentage discount, the discount amount property
        is the price multiplied by the value property. For line item discounts, the
        value property is applied per individual unit of the item, based on the line
        item''s quantity. Calculating line item discount amounts For fixed_amount
        discounts, the total amount corresponds to the line item quantity times the
        value of the discount. For percentage discounts, the total amount corresponds
        to the following: amount = floor(price * quantity * value) / 100, where floor()
        is the usual round down function. For non-fractional currencies, this formula
        needs to use round() instead of floor(), and the division by 100 takes place
        inside the rounding, resulting in a non-fractional value. Otherwise, an error
        is returned. amount = round(price * quantity * value / 100) Line item examples
        Fixed amount discount For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with $5
        dollars off, discount amount corresponds to $10 ($5 * 2): applied_discount:
        { "value_type": "fixed_amount", "value": 5, "amount": 10 } Percentage discount
        For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with 15% off, discount amount
        corresponds to $5.99 (floor ($19.99 * 2 * 15) / 100): applied_discount: {
        "value_type": "percentage", "value": 15, "amount": 5.99 } Loading and removing
        customers You can load a customer to a draft order by sending the customer_id
        as part of the draft order resource. We recommend removing a customer from
        a draft order by making a POST request with the Customer resource set to null,
        without specifying an email, shipping address, or billing address. A customer
        can also be removed by setting customer, email, shipping_address, and billing_address
        to null.'

        a specific time of year. For example, a marketing event can be created to
        track a Facebook ad campaign for Christmas 2022. When creating the marketing
        event, the body of the request includes the UTM parameters that must be included
        in the links provided in the marketing event. Each marketing event also includes
        the event_type and marketing_channel properties that help Shopify to rank
        your app and surface it within Shopify admin. After a marketing event is created
        in Shopify, you can start to drive traffic to Shopify. Make sure that the
        links for the marketing event contain the same UTM parameters that were defined
        in the marketing event. For example, marketing activities for the Christmas
        2022 ad campaign would use the following URL convention: https://storename.com/product?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Christmas2022-12142018'

        not claim inventory. decrement_ignoring_policy: Ignore the product''s inventory
        policy and claim inventory. decrement_obeying_policy: Follow the product''s
        inventory policy and claim inventory, if possible. send_receipt: Whether to

        working on a private app and order confirmations are still being sent to the
        customer when send_receipt is set to false, then you need to disable the Storefront
        API from the private app''s page in the Shopify admin. send_fulfillment_receipt:
        Whether to send a shipping confirmation to the customer. (default: `false`)
        Note If you are including shipping_address or billing_address, make sure to

        ignored. Usage notes: If you''re using this endpoint with a trial or Partner
        development store, then you can create no more than 5 new orders per minute.'
